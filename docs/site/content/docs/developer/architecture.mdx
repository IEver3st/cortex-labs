Cortex Studio is a desktop app with a React + Three.js UI, powered by Tauri 2.

## Frontend

- **React** drives the UI (tabs, settings, workflows).
- **Three.js** renders models and textures in real time.

Key areas:

- Viewer rendering + controls live in the viewer components.
- Format parsing helpers live under `src/lib/`.

## Desktop runtime (Tauri)

Tauri provides:

- Native dialogs
- File system access
- Window controls and app lifecycle

UI-only mode is still useful, but native integrations require the Tauri runtime.

## YFT parsing & mesh caching

Some `.yft` loading uses a sidecar process to generate a cached mesh file (`.clmesh`).

- The cache is keyed by input path + modified time + file size.
- The frontend parses `.clmesh` into Three.js geometry for fast reloads.

See **Reference → YFT Parser CLI Contract** for the sidecar interface.
