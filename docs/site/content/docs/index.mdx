Cortex Studio is a real-time 3D livery previewer and workflow tool for GTA V / FiveM assets.
It’s built for fast iteration: save from your editor → Cortex reloads → inspect the result instantly.

## What you can do

- Preview vehicle liveries and textures on supported models.
- Switch between viewing modes (Livery / All / EUP / Multi).
- Use the **PSD Variant Builder** to manage variant layer visibility and export batches.
- Tune preview lighting, glossiness, and background to simulate different looks.
