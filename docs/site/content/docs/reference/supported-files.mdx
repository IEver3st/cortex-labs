## Models

Cortex Studio focuses on GTA V / FiveM formats.

- `.yft` — vehicles
- `.ydd` — clothing / EUP
- `.dff` — legacy model support
- `.clmesh` — cached mesh format used internally for fast reloads

### Explicit non-support

- `.obj` is intentionally not supported.

## Textures

Supported texture inputs include:

- `.png`
- `.jpg` / `.jpeg`
- `.dds`
- `.psd`

The UI may accept additional image formats for some workflows, but the core “fast loop” targets the formats above.

## Notes on PSD

PSD support is intended for livery iteration and variant workflows.
If you run into warnings or load failures, export a PNG to validate whether the issue is PSD-specific or content-specific.
