## “File picker does nothing” or “Open model” is disabled

You’re probably running the UI-only server.

- Recommended: run the desktop app:

```bash
bun run tauri dev
```

## Model loads but nothing renders

Try these checks:

- Toggle the grid to confirm the scene is alive.
- Use camera reset/fit.
- Try **All** mode to force texture application everywhere.
- If the model is extremely tiny/huge, check scale/orientation.

## `.yft` fails to load / mentions mesh cache

- Ensure `CodeWalkerBridge.exe` exists in one of the expected locations.
- Confirm the bridge prints JSON metadata to stdout and writes the `.clmesh` file.

See **YFT Parser CLI Contract** for exact requirements.

## Texture reload feels inconsistent

Some editors save via temp-file replacement.

Try:

- Re-selecting the texture path.
- Using PNG as a control test.
- Ensuring the file extension is supported.

## Glass/window targeting is wrong

- In Livery mode, auto-targeting is heuristic.
- Use the glass/window selection tools to override.
- If “Exterior Only” is enabled, it may exclude the material you expect.

## Multi mode: gizmo doesn’t appear

- Toggle the Multi gizmo (default hotkey: Alt + G).
- Ensure you’ve selected a slot (A/B) before trying to move it.

## Reset to defaults

If the UI feels “weird” after lots of changes:

- Open Settings and use reset options.
- Restart the app.

Settings are stored locally, so resets are safe and don’t affect your files.
