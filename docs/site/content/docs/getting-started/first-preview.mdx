## 1) Launch a viewer tab

From the Home screen you can launch a mode directly:

- **Livery** (Alt + 1)
- **All** (Alt + 2)
- **EUP** (Alt + 3)
- **Multi** (Alt + 4)

## 2) Load a model

Use the model picker (or drag/drop if enabled) and select one of:

- `.yft` (vehicles)
- `.ydd` (clothing / EUP)
- `.dff`
- `.clmesh` (cached meshes)

## 3) Load your texture

Pick the main texture file:

- `.png`
- `.jpg` / `.jpeg`
- `.dds`
- `.psd` (useful if you prefer direct PSD preview)

## 4) Save in your editor → see it update

Cortex Studio is designed for the loop:

1. Edit your texture in Photoshop / GIMP / etc.
2. Save the file
3. Cortex reloads the texture and updates the 3D view

If your editor saves via “safe write” (temp file + rename), and reload seems unreliable, try re-selecting the texture once or toggling reload.

## 5) Tune the look

Use the viewer controls to adjust:

- Background color
- Body color (where applicable)
- Light intensity
- Glossiness

These are preview helpers so you can sanity-check readability under different lighting.
