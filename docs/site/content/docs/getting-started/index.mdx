description: Install Cortex Studio, run it locally, and make your first live preview.

This section gets you from a fresh clone to a working desktop build, then walks through a first preview workflow.

## You’ll need

- **Bun** for the frontend toolchain.
- **Rust toolchain** for Tauri 2 builds.
- **Windows** (this repo targets Windows-first; other OS support depends on your Tauri setup).
