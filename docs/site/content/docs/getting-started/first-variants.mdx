title: First Variants Project
description: Use the PSD Variant Builder to create, preview, and export variants.
---

The Variant Builder is an IDE-style workflow for layered PSD projects.

## 1) Create a Variant Builder tab

From the Home screen, click **Variant Builder**.

## 2) Load your PSD

Choose a `.psd` file. Cortex Studio will parse:

- Layer hierarchy (groups + layers)
- Visibility flags

## 3) (Optional) Load a model for 3D preview

Set a vehicle or clothing model to see your composited output applied instantly.

## 4) Create variants

- Start from **Base**.
- Duplicate/rename variants.
- Each variant stores its own layer visibility state.

## 5) Export

Export variants as PNGs (up to 4K) into an output folder.

If you’re setting up a shared workflow, consider choosing a stable export folder per project in Settings.
