description: Set up the repo, install dependencies, and run the desktop app.
---

## Prerequisites

- **Bun**
- **Rust** (stable toolchain)
- **Tauri prerequisites** (Windows build tools as required by Tauri)

## Install dependencies

From the repo root:

```bash
bun install
```

## Run (recommended)

Run the desktop app with native integrations:

```bash
bun run tauri dev
```

This is the mode you want for:

- File pickers and native dialogs
- File system access (read/write)
- External open-path/open-url integration

## Run UI-only (limited)

```bash
bun run dev
```

UI-only mode is useful for iterating on layout, but **some features won’t work** because file system plugins are not available.

## Build

```bash
bun run tauri build
```

## CodeWalker bridge (YFT mesh cache)

Some `.yft` workflows rely on a CodeWalker-based sidecar (`CodeWalkerBridge.exe`) to generate a `.clmesh` cache.

- Contract: see **Reference → YFT Parser CLI Contract**.
- Source project: `tools/codewalker-bridge/`.

If `.yft` parsing fails, check that the executable exists in one of the expected locations.
