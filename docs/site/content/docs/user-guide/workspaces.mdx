Cortex Studio treats each session as a **workspace**.

## What a workspace stores

Workspaces are saved locally and include:

- Which page you were on (Viewer or Variants)
- Key state (model path, texture paths, mode, and other viewer settings)
- Variant Builder state (PSD path, variants, export preferences)

## Recents

The Home screen can show recent workspaces.

- You can disable recents in Settings.
- The list is capped to a small maximum so it stays fast.

## Tabs

Cortex Studio uses a browser-style tab bar.

- Tabs stay mounted for instant switching (important for WebGL).
- You can rename tabs, duplicate, and close them.
- New viewer tabs can be opened via hotkeys (Alt + 1/2/3/4 by default).
