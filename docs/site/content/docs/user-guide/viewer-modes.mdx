Cortex Studio’s viewer supports multiple modes, optimized for different workflows.

## Livery mode (Alt + 1)

Best for **vehicle liveries**.

- Attempts to auto-target common “livery / carpaint / decal” materials.
- Designed so your texture applies where you expect without manually picking a mesh.
- Optional **Exterior Only** behavior to avoid pushing livery textures onto interior/glass candidates.

Use this mode when:

- Your `.yft` has typical GTA material naming conventions.
- You want a quick “does it look right in-game?” preview.

## All mode (Alt + 2)

Best for **templates** and broad inspection.

- Applies the loaded texture to *every* mesh/material.
- Useful for checking UV alignment and spotting unexpected UV islands.

Use this mode when:

- You’re validating a blank template.
- You don’t want auto-targeting logic to hide issues.

## EUP mode (Alt + 3)

Best for **clothing models**.

- Intended for `.ydd` workflows.
- Uses clothing-friendly model scanning settings.

Use this mode when:

- You’re previewing Emergency Uniform Pack assets.

## Multi mode (Alt + 4)

Best for **comparisons**.

- Shows two models side-by-side with independent texture selection.
- Includes a transform gizmo for positioning and layout.

Use this mode when:

- You want to compare “before/after” textures.
- You’re validating consistency across variants or across two assets.
