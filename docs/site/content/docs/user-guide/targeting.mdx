## Texture targets

Depending on the mode, Cortex Studio can:

- Auto-target likely livery materials (Livery mode)
- Apply to all meshes (All mode)
- Let you target specific meshes/materials

If your asset uses unusual naming, you may need to manually target a material or mesh.

## Exterior-only filtering

In Livery mode, “Exterior Only” tries to avoid applying the livery texture to:

- Glass/window materials
- Interior tokens (seats, dash, etc.)
- Tires/rims and other non-body parts

This is a heuristic based on material and mesh naming, so results depend on your source asset.

## Window / glass workflows

Cortex Studio supports a separate “window texture” path for assets that split livery/body and glass/window visuals.

Typical use cases:

- Apply a primary livery texture to paint/body.
- Apply a second texture (or template) to glass/window materials.

If auto-detection picks the wrong glass material, use the glass/window selection tools to override the target.

## Vertex colors and material behavior

Some models rely on vertex colors and specific roughness/metalness defaults.
Cortex Studio approximates a PBR-ish preview for fast iteration.

When something looks “off”, try:

- lowering glossiness
- changing background color
- verifying you’re in the intended mode (Livery vs All)
