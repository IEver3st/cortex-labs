title: PSD Variant Builder
description: Manage layered PSD projects, build variants, and export batches.
---

The Variant Builder is built for complex livery projects where one PSD produces many outputs.

## Concepts

### PSD project

A PSD is treated as the source-of-truth. Cortex Studio parses its layer tree and uses that to build composites.

### Variant

A **variant** is a saved set of layer visibilities.

- Base variant exists by default.
- Variants can be duplicated and renamed.
- Each variant can be locked to prevent accidental edits.

## Typical workflow

1. Load a `.psd`.
2. Load a model for 3D preview (optional but recommended).
3. Create variants like “Base”, “Night”, “HiVis”, “Stealth”.
4. Toggle layer visibility per variant.
5. Export all variants to PNG.

## Layer controls

- Toggle layers on/off.
- Collapse/expand groups.
- Solo workflows exist for quickly isolating one layer while you inspect.

## Export

- Configure export size (up to 4096).
- Pick an output folder.
- Export all variants in one pass.

If you want consistent output locations, set a default folder in Settings.

## Limits and expectations

- This is not a full Photoshop replacement; it’s focused on visibility-based variants.
- Visual fidelity depends on the PSD’s layer structure and the model’s material conventions.
