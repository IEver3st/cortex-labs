## Camera navigation

The viewer uses an orbit-style camera.

- **Left mouse**: orbit
- **Middle mouse / wheel**: zoom
- **Right mouse**: pan

If your setup differs (touchpad, tablet, etc.), behavior may vary.

## Presets and reset

Cortex Studio provides quick camera presets (front/side/angle/top) and a reset/fit action so you can recover quickly after aggressive navigation.

## WASD flight controls

An optional WASD mode exists for more “freecam” movement.

- Enable it in **Settings → Viewer**.
- Use it when you need to inspect interiors or awkward geometry.

## Grid

A floor grid helps with:

- Orientation
- Scale sanity checks
- Detecting upside-down / rotated imports

## Lighting and glossiness

These controls are meant to simulate a range of “looks” rather than match GTA’s renderer 1:1.

- **Light intensity**: overall scene lighting
- **Glossiness**: adjusts material roughness behavior
- **Background color**: makes decals and edge-work easier to judge

Tip: For subtle decals, try a darker background with slightly lower glossiness to see banding and edge artifacts.
