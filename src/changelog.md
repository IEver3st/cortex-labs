# Faster Updates and Clearer Release Notes

> This release makes texture iteration faster in Multi mode and introduces a cleaner, always-available What’s New experience.

## New

- Multi Texture Auto-Reload | In Multi mode, both texture slots now hot-reload when their source files change.
- Release Notes in Settings | Open What’s New anytime from Settings → About, even after dismissing it.
- Copy Markdown Button | Copy a Discord-friendly summary of this version’s notes with one click.

## Improved

- Centered What’s New Modal | The dialog now opens centered consistently across different window sizes.
- Cleaner Change Layout | Notes are grouped into New, Improved, and Fix cards for faster scanning.
- Better Keyboard Flow | Press Esc to close quickly and use keyboard focus for primary actions.

## Fixed

- Watcher Mode Conflicts | Switching between single-texture and Multi watch modes no longer causes watcher overlap.
- Version Display Reliability | What’s New is shown once per version by default, with manual reopen still available.
